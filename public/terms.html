            <h1>Terms and Conditions for Claro AI</h1>
            <p class="effective-date">Effective Date: 08.04.2025</p>

            <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
            <p>Welcome to Claro AI (the "App"), developed and operated by Crowd Wisdom SL ("we," "us," or "our"). By accessing or using the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions ("Terms"). If you do not agree to these Terms, please discontinue use of the App.</p>
            <p>We may update these Terms from time to time; the latest version will always be available in the App and on our website. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.</p>

            <h2>2. Service Description and Limitations</h2>
            <p>Core Functionality:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Claro AI provides speech transcription, translation, and text-to-speech ("TTS") services.</li>
                <li>Please note that the quality, accuracy, and timeliness of transcriptions, translations, and TTS outputs are dependent on several factors (e.g., ambient noise, clarity of speech, third-party service performance). We are not responsible for inaccuracies or errors in these outputs.</li>
                <li>Any downtime or performance disruptions are generally attributable to our third-party service providers.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. User Eligibility and Account Registration</h2>
            <p>The App is available to all users without age restrictions, and there are no features in the App that are dangerous for minors.</p>
            <p>When registering an account using email/password or social login methods (Google, Apple, Facebook), you agree to provide accurate information and are responsible for maintaining the security of your credentials. You must not share your password or other sensitive login details with any third party.</p>
            <p>Users are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of their account and login credentials.</p>

            <h2>4. Subscription, Billing, and Payment Terms</h2>
            <p>The App offers both a non-renewable one-week package and a monthly subscription.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>For one-week packages, no refunds will be issued.</li>
                <li>Monthly subscriptions are cancellable at any time, but no refunds will be provided for canceled subscriptions.</li>
                <li>Payment processing and refunds (if applicable) are managed by the relevant payment platform (iOS App Store or Google Play), and your subscription is subject to their terms and conditions.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>5. Acceptable Use and Prohibited Activities</h2>
            <p>You agree to use the App only for lawful purposes and in accordance with these Terms.</p>
            <p>Prohibited activities include, but are not limited to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Misuse of the App or its services</li>
                <li>Abusive behavior, harassment, or any actions deemed harmful or fraudulent</li>
                <li>Attempts to bypass security or disrupt the functioning of the App</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Any violation of these guidelines may result in the immediate suspension or termination of your account.</p>

            <h2>6. Intellectual Property and User-Generated Content</h2>
            <p>We assert full ownership of Claro AI's design, code, and overall intellectual property.</p>
            <p>You retain ownership of any content you generate while using the App (e.g., uploaded profile pictures, comments, or similar material). By submitting user-generated content, you grant us a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to use, display, and distribute that content for the purpose of operating and promoting the App.</p>
            <p>This license does not permit the third party use of your content beyond the scope of the App unless you explicitly agree otherwise.</p>

            <h2>7. Disclaimers and Limitation of Liability</h2>
            <p>Service Accuracy: The App's outputs (transcriptions, translations, and TTS) are provided on an "as is" basis. We do not guarantee the accuracy, reliability, or completeness of these services.</p>
            <p>Disruptions: While we take reasonable steps to maintain the App's functionality, we are not responsible for any disruptions or downtime caused by third-party service failures or other external factors.</p>
            <p>Liability Cap: In no event shall we be liable for indirect, incidental, or consequential damages (including loss of data, revenue, or profit) arising from your use of the Appâ€”even if advised of the possibility of such damages. The liability of Crowd Wisdom SL shall in no case exceed the amount you have paid for using the App in the preceding three months.</p>

            <h2>8. Termination and Account Suspension</h2>
            <p>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your account immediately if you violate these Terms (such as through misuse or abusive behavior).</p>
            <p>If you experience any issues or wish to dispute a suspension or termination, please contact us directly via live chat on our website or email us at contact@allclaro.com.</p>

            <h2>9. Dispute Resolution and Governing Law</h2>
            <p>Governing Law: These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Spain, without regard to conflicts of law principles.</p>
            <p>Jurisdiction: Any disputes arising from or in connection with these Terms shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Spanish courts.</p>
            <p>US Customers: While we primarily operate under the Spanish legal system, if you are a customer from the United States, you agree that any disputes will still be resolved under Spanish law and jurisdiction, unless otherwise mandated by applicable consumer protection laws.</p>

            <h2>10. Modification of Terms</h2>
            <p>We may modify these Terms at any time. Changes will be posted on our website and the App.</p>
            <p>Your continued use of Claro AI after the updated Terms have been posted constitutes your acceptance of the modifications.</p>

            <h2>11. Additional Disclaimers</h2>
            <p>Third-Party Services: We are not responsible for any service interruptions or errors that stem from our third-party providers (e.g., Firebase, OpenAI, Google, ElevenLabs, Groq, Deepgram).</p>
            <p>Support: For any questions or issues regarding the App, please contact our support via live chat on our website or email contact@allclaro.com.</p>
