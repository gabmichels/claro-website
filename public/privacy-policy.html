            <p class="effective-date">Effective Date: 08.04.2025</p>

            <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
            <p>Welcome to Claro AI ("the App"), developed and operated by Crowd Wisdom SL ("we," "us," or "our"). We are a one-person business based in Spain, with a registered office at Rambla de Catalunya 38, 8-1, 08007 Barcelona. This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, store, and share your information when you use Claro AI.</p>
            <p>By using Claro AI, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, please discontinue use of the App.</p>

            <h2>2. Data We Collect</h2>
            <p><strong>Account Information</strong></p>
            <p>Authentication Data:</p>
            <p>We use Firebase Authentication for user management. When you create an account or log in, we collect:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Email address (for email/password, Google, Apple, and Facebook logins)</li>
                <li>A unique user ID (provided by the authentication provider)</li>
                <li>Authentication provider type (Google, Apple, Facebook, or email/password)</li>
                <li>Whether your account is anonymous or authenticated</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Profile Information:</p>
            <p>Stored in our Firebase Firestore database, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Email address (if provided)</li>
                <li>Profile picture (if uploaded, stored in Google Cloud Storage in the EU region)</li>
                <li>Account creation date</li>
                <li>Last login date</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Device Information</strong></p>
            <p>We collect your device type (e.g., Android or iOS) and a device ID for security and anti-abuse purposes. This information is stored in our Firebase Firestore database.</p>

            <p><strong>Subscription and Payment Information</strong></p>
            <p>When you purchase a subscription, we store:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Subscription status (active, canceled, etc.)</li>
                <li>Subscription type (one-time or recurring)</li>
                <li>Purchase tokens and verification data</li>
                <li>Payment platform (iOS App Store or Google Play)</li>
                <li>Subscription start and expiration dates</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Payment processing is handled via platform-specific APIs. We do not store or access your credit card or payment details.</p>

            <p><strong>Usage Data</strong></p>
            <p>We log user-specific metrics, such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Total messages sent</li>
                <li>Total tokens used</li>
                <li>Total translation characters</li>
                <li>Total text-to-speech characters</li>
                <li>App settings and preferences</li>
                <li>Other metadata related to App usage</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This usage data is associated with your user ID and stored in Google Cloud Firestore (EU region).</p>

            <p>Retention & Periodic Review:</p>
            <p>We retain usage data for as long as necessary for operational and analytical purposes or until you delete your account. Personal data (e.g., email, profile picture) is deleted immediately upon account deletion, although anonymized usage metrics may be retained. We periodically review our data retention practices to ensure data is not held longer than necessary.</p>

            <p><strong>Audio and Text Content</strong></p>
            <p>Processing Only, No Storage:</p>
            <p>All audio recordings and text are processed locally for transcription, translation, and text-to-speech services. We do not store the content of your messages or recordings on our servers.</p>

            <p>Third-Party Processing:</p>
            <p>The necessary data (e.g., the audio or text required for processing) is transmitted in real time to our third-party service providers (OpenAI, Google, ElevenLabs, Groq, Deepgram) solely for the purpose of delivering the requested services. We ensure that only the minimum necessary data is sent and that no additional personally identifying information is included.</p>

            <p>No Permanent Storage:</p>
            <p>Once the processing is completed, your content is not retained by us. Only anonymized usage metadata may be stored for operational and analytical purposes, as described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy.</p>

            <p><strong>No Special Category Data</strong></p>
            <p>We do not intentionally collect or process sensitive personal data (e.g., health, biometric, or child-specific data).</p>

            <p><strong>Children's Data</strong></p>
            <p>Claro AI is not directed at or intended for use by children under 16. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children. If you believe a child has provided us with personal data, please contact us immediately.</p>

            </ul>
            <p>Note: When transferring data to third-party services (OpenAI, Google, ElevenLabs, Groq, Deepgram), we include only the minimum necessary information and do not transmit additional personal identifiers.</p>

            <p><strong>Subscription Management:</strong></p>

            <p>We use Firebase Analytics (and potentially Google Analytics in the future) to understand user interactions and improve the App</p>
            <p>Usage data assists with performance evaluation, issue detection, and technical problem diagnosis</p>

            <p><strong>Anti-Abuse and Security:</strong></p>
            <p>The device ID and other security-related data are used to detect and prevent fraudulent or malicious activities and ensure platform integrity</p>

            <p><strong>Future Marketing Efforts:</strong></p>
            <p>Currently, we do not share personal data with marketing providers. In the future, should we initiate marketing activities that involve data sharing with third parties (e.g., for newsletters or promotional materials), such sharing will be subject to strict contractual obligations and standard safeguards. Any changes will be reflected in an updated Privacy Policy.</p>

            <h2>4. Data Sharing and Transfers</h2>

            <p><strong>International Data Transfers</strong></p>
            <p>While we aim to keep personal data within the EU, some service providers (e.g., OpenAI, Groq, ElevenLabs) may process data outside the EU/EEA. We ensure that appropriate safeguards (such as Standard Contractual Clauses) are in place to comply with GDPR requirements.</p>
