        <div class="mb-8">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Why Claro over Google Translate? Aren't there 1000s of translation apps</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Yes, there are a gazillion translation apps. But all of them are pre-AI. I went out there and searched the AI-tech that could provide the best user experience. And that is why I built Claro: To provide a great translation experience. Yes, Google translate is the GO-TO app. But conversations are not it's strength. There is a funny story that triggered the idea: <br> Over Christmas we went with a group of friends to Belgium. We ended up in a sandwich shop. None of us spoke french and none of the people working in the shop spoke english. It was a disaster getting all our sandwiches and I just thought: "How are we in the AI age of 2025 and there is still no good translation solution. That's when I decided to build a conversation-first translator</p>
